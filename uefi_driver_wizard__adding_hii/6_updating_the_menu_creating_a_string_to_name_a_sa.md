## Lab 6\. Updating the Menu: Creating a String to Name a Saved Configuration {#6-updating-the-menu-creating-a-string-to-name-a-saved-configuration}

In this lab, you’ll create a string to name a saved configuration that will be stored into the NVRAM variable space. This lab uses the VFR term “string” to prompt the user to enter a string value. The VFR can determine the minimum and maximum number of characters of the string length with the terms “`minsize`” and “`maxsize`”. Since there is also an enable/disable switch, the VFR can use the “`grayoutif`” term again to allow or disallow changes to this field.

###### Figure 6 : Menu with a string item

1.  **Update** the MyWizardDriver.vfr file 
2.  **Add** the following code to the location at approx. line 77 and before the “`resetbutton`” item (as shown below): 
```
//
// Define a string (EFI_IFR_STRING) to name the configuration in the 
// NVRAM variable
//
  grayoutif  ideqval MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverChooseToEnable == 0x0;
    string    varid    = MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverStringData,
              prompt   = STRING_TOKEN(STR_MY_STRING_PROMPT),
              help     = STRING_TOKEN(STR_MY_STRING_HELP),
              minsize  = 3,
              maxsize  = 20,
    endstring;
  endif;
```

3. **Save** MyWizardDriver.vfr 
4. **Update** MyWizardDriver.uni 
5. **Add** the following code to the bottom of the file: <br>

```

#string STR_MY_STRING_PROMPT           #language en "Name of Configuration"
#string STR_MY_STRING_HELP             #language en "Enter a name for this configuration. This string can is 3 to 20 characters"

```
![](/media/image61.png)<br>
6). **Save** MyWizardDriver.uni 

#### Build and test MyWizardDriver

1. **Open** the Visual Studio Command Prompt
2. **Type** build
3. **Type** build run
4. At the UEFI Shell prompt,type **exit**<br>
![](/media/image46.png)
5. Now at the setup front page menu,** select** “Device Manager”
6. Inside the Device Manager menu** press **the down arrow to “My Wizard Driver Sample Formset” **Press** "Enter"
7. **Select **“Name of Configuration” then **Press** “Enter” <br>
**Notice **the string text pop up menu gets displayed.
![](/media/image62.png)
8. **Test** the “`minsize`” by only **typing** your choice of a two character string. Then **Press** “Enter” <br>
**Notice** the an error message validating that you need to enter at least three or more characters. 
![](/media/image63.png)
9. **Press** “Enter” to clear the message 
10. **Press** “Enter” again to re-enter pop up menu 
11. **Test **by** typing **more than “`maxsize`” of 20 characters**** Then  **Press** “Enter” . <br>
**Notice** that the Browser only allows the maximum number of 20 characters to be entered with a forced stop. There is no error message but no more characters are allowed to be typed into the pop up menu.
![](/media/image64.png)
12. **Press** “Enter” <br>
**Notice** that the “**Configuration changed**” message is displayed
![](/media/image65.png) 
13.  **Test** the `grayoutif` by selecting **“Enable My XYZ Device”** 
14. **Press** the “Spacebar” to toggle off/disable.  Then **Press** the “Spacebar” again to Enable. <br>
**Notice** that the “Select Base Address”  and “Name of Configruation” fields are  now grayed out and not selectable 
![](/media/image66.png)
15. **Press **“F10” to save.
16. **Press ** “Escape” to exit
17. **Press ** “Escape” to exit the “Device Manager”
18.  **Select** “Continue”  and then **Press ** “Enter”
19.  At the Shell Prompt, **type** `dmpstore -all` <br>
**Notice** the unicode string “`12345678901234567890`” (or the 20 character value you typed) is now stored 
because you entered those characters in the HII form menu.  This is because the file `WizardDriverNVDataStruc.h` has the data structure stored in NVRAM with the GUID define name `MWD_IfrNVData `of type `MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION`.  Notice that string data is the first 20 bytes in the data structure `MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverStringData`.
