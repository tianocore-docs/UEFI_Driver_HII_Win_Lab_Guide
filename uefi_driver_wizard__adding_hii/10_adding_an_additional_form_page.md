## Lab 10\. Adding an Additional Form Page {#10-adding-an-additional-form-page}

In this lab, you’ll learn how to add another form page to your My Wizard Driver menu by using the “`goto`” VFR term along with the “`form`” and “`formid`” VFR statements. Additionally, use “`surpressif`” or “`grayoutif`” to conditionally allow the user to enter your additional forms.

In addition, this lab will show how the “time” and “date” VFR terms are used within the VFR language to special case how the browser engine checks the time instead of your driver manually checking (e.g. leap year).

###### Figure 10: Second setup page

1. **Update** the MyWizardDriverNVDataStruc.h file 
2. **Add** the following date and time fields to the configuration `typedef` (to to the location shown below): 
```
  EFI_HII_TIME  Time;
  EFI_HII_DATE  Date;
```
![](/media/image92.png)
3. **Save** MyWizardDriverNVDataStruc.h 
4. **Update** the MyWizardDriver.uni file 
5. **Add** the following code to the end of the file to update the second page’s string:<br>

```
#string STR_FORM2_TITLE                #language en "MyWizardDriver Second Setup Page"
#string STR_DATE_PROMPT                #language en "System Date"
#string STR_DATE_HELP                  #language en "This is the help for the Date (month/day/year). (Error checking will be done against month/day/year combinations that are not supported.)"
#string STR_TIME_PROMPT                #language en "System Time"
#string STR_TIME_HELP                  #language en "This is the help for the Time (hour/minute/second)."
#string STR_ERROR_POPUP                #language en "You typed in the wrong value!"
 
#string STR_GOTO_FORM1                 #language en "Enter Page 1"
#string STR_GOTO_FORM2                 #language en "Enter Page 2"
#string STR_GOTO_HELP                  #language en "This is my goto help"
          
#string STR_MY_DATE_PROMPT             #language en "My System Date"
 
#string STR_MY_TIME_PROMPT             #language en "My System Time"

```

6). **Save** MyWizardDriver.uni <br>
7). **Update** the MyWizardDriver.vfr file <br>

8). **Add** the “`goto`” VFR item to allow browser to ender another form by adding the following code before the "`endform`” at approx. line 114 <Br>


```
grayoutif  ideqval MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverChooseToEnable == 0x0;
        goto 2,
      prompt = STRING_TOKEN(STR_GOTO_FORM2), //SecondSetupPage  
      help   = STRING_TOKEN(STR_GOTO_HELP);
   endif;

```
![](/media/image93.png)<br>

9).  **Add** the following code between “`endform`” at approx. line 120 and “`endformset`” (the code continues for few pages in this lab guide):

```
// Begin code

    form formid = 2,               // SecondSetupPage,
      title = STRING_TOKEN(STR_FORM2_TITLE);

```

10). **Save** MyWizardDriver.vfr 

#### Build and test MyWizardDriver

1. **Open** the Visual Studio Command Prompt
2. **Type** build
3. **Type** build run
4. At the UEFI Shell prompt,type **exit**<br>
5. Now at the setup front page menu,** select** “Device Manager”
6. Inside the Device Manager menu** press **the down arrow to “My Wizard Driver Sample Formset” **Press** "Enter" 
![](/media/image94.png)
<br>
**Notice**  the “Enter Page 2” option.  Without `goto` in the `MyWizardDriver.vfr` file, you wouldn’t be able to access page two.  
7. **Select** “Enter Page 2” and then **Press** “Enter” <br>
**Notice** how the System Date and Time cannot be modified to any other date/time and is grayed out:
![](/media/SystemDateMenu.JPG)
8. **Test **by trying to enter the date 02/30/2013, then try a valid leap year date: 02/29/2012.
9. **Press** “Down Arrow” to return to Page 1 
10. **Test** the “`grayoutif”` by going to “Enable My XYZ Device”
11. **Press** the “Spacebar” to toggle off/disable<br>
**Notice **the “Select Base Address” , “Name of Configuration” and the “Enter Page 2” fields are now grayed out and not selectable
![](/media/image96.png)
12. **Press ** “Space bar” again to Enable
13. **Press **“F10” then “Escape” to save and exit
14. **Press **“Escape” to exit “Device Manager”
15. **Select** “Continue” and then **Press** "Enter”
16. **Type** “reset” <br>
![](/media/image97.png) <br>
at the Shell prompt and then **Press** “Enter” to return to the Visual Studio Command Prompt <br>

For any build issues copy the solution files from C:\Fw\LabSolutions\LessonE.10

NOTE: Del Directory C:\fw\edk2\Build\NT32IA32\DEBUG_VS2010x86\IA32\MyWizardDriver before the Build command to build the MyWizardDriver Clean.
