## Lab 7\. Updating the Menu: Numeric Entry {#7-updating-the-menu-numeric-entry}

In this lab, you’ll learn how to add a numeric entry to your driver menu. This lab uses the VFR term “`numeric`” that prompts the user to enter a free-form numeric value. The VFR determines the minimum and maximum values with the terms “`minimum`” and “`maximum`”. Since there is also an enable/disable switch, the VFR uses the “`suppressif`” term to display or hide this field when disabled. Also this field displays as decimal (default) or hexadecimal with the “`flags`” switch.

###### Figure 7 : Menu with Numeric item entry

1. **Update** the MyWizardDriver.vfr file 
2.  **Add** the following code in the location shown below at approx. Line 90 and before the “`resetbutton`” item: 
```
//
// Define a numeric free form menu item 
//
  suppressif  ideqval MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverChooseToEnable == 0x0;
   numeric varid   = MWD_IfrNVData.MyWizardDriverHexData,                          
            prompt  = STRING_TOKEN(STR_DATA_HEX_PROMPT),
            help    = STRING_TOKEN(STR_NUMERIC_HELP),
            flags   = DISPLAY_UINT_HEX ,     // Display in HEX format (if not specified, default is in decimal format)
            minimum = 0,
```
![](/media/image69.png)
3. **Save** MyWizardDriver.vfr 
4. **Update** the MyWizardDriver.uni file 
5. **Add** the following code to the bottom of the file:

```
#string STR_DATA_HEX_PROMPT            #language en "Enter ZY Base (Hex)"
#string STR_NUMERIC_HELP               #language en "This is the help for entering a Base address in Hex. The valid range in this case is from 0 to 250."

```
6).  **Save** MyWizardDriver.uni 


#### Build and test MyWizardDriver

1. **Open** the Visual Studio Command Prompt
2. **Type** build
3. **Type** build run
4. At the UEFI Shell prompt,type **exit**<br>
![](/media/image46.png)
5. Now at the setup front page menu,** select** “Device Manager”
6. Inside the Device Manager menu** press **the down arrow to “My Wizard Driver Sample Formset” **Press** "Enter"<br>
**Notice** the value for “Enter ZY Base(Hex)” is `022`.  Hex is the default because of the VFR field “`default = 0x22`”
![](/media/image70.png)
7. **Select** “Enter ZY Base(Hex)”  and then **Press** “Enter” 
8. **Test** by typing a “`M`” character<br>
**Notice** that only Numeric characters are allowed and also only values `00` to `0FA` Hex. When values outside the range or non-numeric characters are entered the red **“!!”** sting is displayed at the bottom of the menu. <br>
The string **“!!”** is part of the Browser engine : `MdeModulePkg\Universal\SetupBrowserDxe\SetupBrowserStr.uni`<BR>
`#string INPUT_ERROR_MESSAGE            #language en-US  "!!"`

9. **Press** “Enter” again 
10. **Test** by typing a value of ‘`99`’ Hex  and then **Press** “Enter” <br>
**Notice** that the “**Configuration changed**” message is displayed.
11. **Test** the “`surpressif`” by pressing the “spacebar” to “Enable My XYZ Device” then press the “Space” bar to toggle off or “Disabled”. <br>
**Notice** the “Select Base Address” and “Name of Configuration” fields are now grayed out and not selectable and the “**Enter ZY Base(Hex)**” does not appear at all. 
![](/media/image72.png)
12. **Press** “Space bar” again to “Enable My XYZ Device” and the“**Enter ZY Base(Hex)**” is displayed again
![](/media/image73.png)
13. **Press** “F10”  to save, then “Escape” to exit
14. **Press** “Escape” to exit the “Device Manager” 
15. **Select “**Continue**”** and then **Press** "Enter”
16. At the Shell Prompt, **type** `dmpstore –all` <br>
**Notice** by `modifyingMyWizardDriverNVDataStruc.h` our data structure stored in NVRAM is named `MWD_IfrNVData` of type `MYWIZARDDRIVER_CONFIGURATION`.
