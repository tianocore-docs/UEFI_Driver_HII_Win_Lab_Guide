## Lab 9\. Add code to your driver when Call Back events occur for Interactive Items {#9-add-code-to-your-driver-when-call-back-events-occur-for-interactive-items}

In this lab, you’ll update your driver to print debug statements when the HII browser engine calls back into your call back function. Every time the browser does anything with the interactive labeled fields there is a call made to your driver’s call back function. We can determine the item by the `quetionid` and what action based on the action passed to your call back function. Your call back function can then add code to special case when these transitions occur.

For this lab we will simply add Debug print statements. However, the use of adding call backs to a driver’s HII functions adds the capability of providing more manageability and flexibility for the interactions between the user, the browser engine, and your driver code. In a real driver firmware situation, it may be desired to implement more complex features and functionality based upon an item changing.

1. **Update** the HiiConfigAccess.c file 
2. **Comment** **out** the DEBUG statement with “`//`” in the `MyWizardDriverHiiConfigAccessCallback` call back function approx. line 330: <br>
`    //`<br>

3. **Add** a switch case statement of the question ID’s to the “Action” switch case of `EFI_BROWSER_ACTION_CHANGING` in the call back function by **adding** a nested switch case code (as shown below at approx. line 372 ) 
```
		 switch (QuestionId) {
			 case 0x1111:
				     DEBUG ((DEBUG_INFO, "\n:: START Call back- Changing ,Question ID=0x%08x Type=0x%04x Action=0x%04x", QuestionId, Type, Action));
				 break;
			 case 0x1001:
				     DEBUG ((DEBUG_INFO, "\n:: START Call back- Changing ,Question ID=0x%08x Type=0x%04x Action=0x%04x", QuestionId, Type, Action));
				 break;
			 default:
				 Status = EFI_UNSUPPORTED;
				 break;
		 }
```

4.  **Add** another nested switch case statement of the question ID’s to the “Action” switch case of EFI_BROWSER_ACTION_CHANGED in the call back function (as show below at approx. line 388): 

```
				 switch (QuestionId) {
			 case 0x1111:
				     DEBUG ((DEBUG_INFO, "\n:: START Call back- Changed ,Question ID=0x%08x Type=0x%04x Action=0x%04x", QuestionId, Type, Action));
				 break;
			 case 0x1001:
				     DEBUG ((DEBUG_INFO, "\n:: START Call back- Changed ,Question ID=0x%08x Type=0x%04x Action=0x%04x", QuestionId, Type, Action));
				 break;
			 default:
				 Status = EFI_UNSUPPORTED;
				 break;
		 }

```

5. **Save** MyWizardDriver.c 

#### Build and test MyWizardDriver

1. **Open** the Visual Studio Command Prompt
2. **Type** build
3. **Type** build run
4. At the UEFI Shell prompt,type **exit**<br>
5. Now at the setup front page menu,** select** “Device Manager”
6. Inside the Device Manager menu** press **the down arrow to “My Wizard Driver Sample Formset” **Press** "Enter"
7.  **Observe **the Visual Studio Command Prompt – build run Window <BR>
**Test:** changing the “Name of Configuration” and the “Enter ZY Base(Hex)” fields while observing the Visual Studio Command Prompt – build run Window
8. **Switch back **to Visual Studio and notice the changes that you made.

**Notice: **when changing the “**Enter ZY Base(Hex)**” field
![](/media/image90.png)
**Notice: **when Pressing “F10”
9. **Press** “Escape” and another "Escape" to exit the “Device Manager”
10. **Select** “Continue” and then **Press** "Enter”
11. **Type** “reset” at the Shell prompt and then **Press** “Enter” to return to the Visual Studio Command Prompt <br>
